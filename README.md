#### Title: Data Centralisation of a Multinational Retail Company [Github repo](https://github.com/tonCodesData/multinational-retail-data-centralisation)

The data of a multinational company that sells various goods across the globe are spread across many different data sources such as AWS RDS, S3 bucket as pdf files, csv, etc, which made it not easily accessible or analysable by current members of the team. In this project, assuming the role of a Data Analyst, I aimed to make its sales data accessible from one centralised location and answer key metrics queries.

In brief, First I build up engines to connect to different data sources using python (sqlalchemy, boto3) to **extract** data saved in different formats such as CSV, JSON, etc. Then I use pandas and numpy to **clean** and **transform** the data and **load** to a PostgreSQL server. There are I make star-based schema and query the database to get up-to-date metrics for the business helping the organisation becoming more data-driven while making their decisions.
